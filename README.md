#Vsd-riscv intership 
#Task 1 
involved creating a GitHub repository named "vsd-riscv" to document the RISC-V lab activities. The program flow was understood by watching the provided video, which guided the execution of both C-based and RISC-V assembly-based labs. The RISC-V GCC toolchain was installed using the VDI link mentioned in the attached PDF. The same steps demonstrated in the C and assembly lab videos were performed on the local machine, and the outputs were verified. Snapshots of the lab executions with the current date and time visible were captured. These images, along with concise descriptions of each step, were uploaded to the repository for proper documentation.
