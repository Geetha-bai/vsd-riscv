# Project name
Full adder
# Overview 
This project involves the implementation of Full Adder combinational circuit using VSDSquadron Mini, a RISCV based SoC development kit. Full Adder is a very important circuit in digital electronics, widely used in creating the design of n-bits Adder circuit. A full adder circuit is a digital circuit that adds two binary digits and a carry-in digit to produce a sum and carry-out digit. It’s a central component of most digital circuits that perform addition or subtraction. This project demonstrates the practical application of digital logic and RISC-V architecture in executing arithmetic operation, reflecting the process of reading and writing of binary data through GPIO pins, implementing the operation of full adder through digital logic gates which is simulated using PlatformIO IDE and thus displaying the outputs using LEDs.

# Components required
•VSDSquadron Mini
•Push Buttons for Input of binary data
•2 LEDs for displaying the Output
•Breadboard
•Jumper Wires
•VS Code for Software Development
PlatformIO multi framework professional IDE
 
# Hardware Connections
•Input: Three input of single bit are connected to the GPIO pins of VSDSquadron Mini via push buttons mounted on the breadboard.
•Outputs: Two LEDs are connected to display the result of Full Adder
•The GPIO pins are configured according to the Reference Mannual, ensuring the correct flow of signals between the components
